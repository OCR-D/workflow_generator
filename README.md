# OCR-D Tool for Evaluation

This tool can be used for evaluation OCR-D processors with taverna workflow.


This java library contains utility classes to extract all metadata of OCR-D workspaces.

## Prerequisites

In order to build this library you'll need:

* Java SE Development Kit 8 or higher
* ocrd 2.7.1 or higher

## Building Tool
For building the tool go to project folder and type:
```bash=bash
# Build library
user@localhost:workflow_generator/$./gradlew clean build 
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 11s
10 actionable tasks: 10 executed
```
As a result, a jar containing all the utility classes is created at 'build/libs/WorkflowTool-0.1.0.jar'.

## First Test
To run tool go to project folder and type:
```bash=bash
# Build library
user@localhost:workflow_generator/$java -jar ./build/libs/WorkflowTool-0.1.0.jar
Missing parameters!
Usage:
  test      path/to/workflow_configuration4permuation.txt [workflow_configuration_new.txt] 
  permutate path/to/workflow_configuration4permuation.txt [workflow_configuration_new.txt [max_no_of_processor_steps_per_file]] 
  eval      path/to/workspace [evaluation_results.csv] 
  listProv  path/to/workspace


Explanation:

Tool for creating workflow configuration file(s) used by taverna workflow.

test      - Compiles a workflow_configuration file with all active processors.
permutate - Compiles workflow_configuration file(s) with all active processors.
eval      - Evaluates the json files generated by dinglehopper.
listProv  - Evaluates the provenance file(s) and prints the input/output file groups of each processor.

# Template for workflow configuration file
You'll find a template for a workflow configuration file with working OCR-D processors at
'src/main/resources/workflow_configuration4permutation.txt'

:NOTE: Before starting replace all Strings '${TAVERNA_INSTALL_DIR} with the installation
directory of taverna. (e.g.: /home/user/ocrd/taverna)
